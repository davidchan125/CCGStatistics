# CCGStatistics
A basic Java GUI application built with Netbeans, which is able to filter values imported from a CSV file (with a search query from the user) and find the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient from 2 columns of numerical values (the columns which are selected are hardcoded). The correlation coefficient is presented numerically with the option to view it in a scatter graph.
